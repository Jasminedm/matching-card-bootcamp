This matching card game allows the user to play a memory matching game. Flip cards over attempting to remember where their matches are as they are hidden until all cards are flipped and matched. Then start over!

I used an card api to complete this project! My code is requesting that this api deal two decks with the same cards in them. Then I use a second fetch to tell the api how many cards to deal from each deck. When the cards are clicked, the img src is changed to the src of the cards from the api to represent the flipping of a card. If the cards match they will stay face up, if not they will flip back over when the next card is chosen. When all cards are face up the game will notify the user that its over! There is a restart button to play again!
